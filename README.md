The RZ/G2L flash writer is sample software for Renesas RZ/G2L Group MPUs.
The RZ/G2L flash writer downloads the some of the raw images from Host PC via SCIF and writes the raw images to the Serial NOR Flash.

## 1. Overview

This document explains about RZ/G2L flash writer sample software for Renesas RZ/G2L Group MPUs.

The RZ/G2L flash writer is downloaded from the Host PC via SCIF by boot ROM.

And the RZ/G2L flash writer downloads the some of the raw images from Host PC via SCIF, and writes the raw images to the Serial NOR Flash (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;Serial Flash&rdquo;).

The RZ/G2L flash writer's Serial Flash writing support is on-board Serial NOR Flash(i.e. MT25QU512).

[Chapter 2](#2-operating-environment) describes the operating environment.

[Chapter 3](#3-software) describes the software.

[Chapter 4](#4-how-to-build-the-rzg2-flash-writer) explains example of how to build the RZ/G2L flash writer.

[Chapter 5](#5-how-to-run-the-rzg2-flash-writer) explains example of how to perform the RZ/G2L flash writer.

[Chapter 6](#6-error-case-to-handle) explains how to handle error case.

[Chapter 7](#7-revision-history) explains revision history.

*Note) This sample software does not support the file system. Therefore, can be write the raw image to the Serial NOR Flash.*

## 4. How to build the RZ/G2L flash writer

This chapter is described how to build the RZ/G2L flash writer.
Command is executed in the user's home directory (~ /).

### 4.1. Prepare the compiler

Gets cross compiler for linaro or setup the Yocto SDK.

ARM64 Cross-compile toolchain:

```shell
cd ~/
wget https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-a/10.2-2020.11/binrel/gcc-arm-10.2-2020.11-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.tar.xz
tar xvf gcc-arm-10.2-2020.11-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.tar.xz
```

Yocto SDK:

```shell
source /opt/poky/3.1.5/environment-setup-aarch64-poky-linux
```

### 4.2. Prepare the source code

Get the source code of RZ/G2L flash writer.

```shell
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/renesas-rz/rzg2_flash_writer.git
cd rzg2_flash_writer
git checkout rz_g2l
```

### 4.3. Build the RZ/G2L flash writer

S-record file will be built by the following command.

ARM64 Cross-compile toolchain:

```shell
make -f makefile.linaro clean
CROSS_COMPILE=~/gcc-arm-10.2-2020.11-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf/bin/aarch64-none-elf- make -f makefile.linaro BOARD=RZG2L_SMARC
```

Yocto SDK:

```shell
make clean
make BOARD=RZG2L_SMARC
```

Output image will be available in the following directory.

* ./AArch64_output/Flash_Writer_SCIF_RZG2L_SMARC_DDR4_2GB.mot

The target file name changes depending on the build options.

The following table lists the relationship between build option and target files.

#### Description of build options and target files

| Build options     | Target filename                                      |
| ----------------- | -----------------------------------------------------|
| RZ/G2L SMARC      | Flash_Writer_SCIF_RZG2L_SMARC_DDR4_2GB.mot           |
| RZ/G2L SMARC PMIC | Flash_Writer_SCIF_RZG2L_SMARC_PMIC_DDR4_2GB_1PCS.mot |
| RZ/V2L SMARC      | Flash_Writer_SCIF_RZV2L_SMARC_DDR4_4GB.mot           |
| RZ/V2L SMARC PMIC | Flash_Writer_SCIF_RZV2L_SMARC_PMIC_DDR4_2GB_1PCS.mot |

## 5. How to run the RZ/G2L flash writer

### 5.1. Prepare for write to the Serial Flash and eMMC

Start the target in the SCIF download mode and run the RZ/G2L flash writer sample code.

Regarding the DIP switch configuration on the board, refer to [Related Document](#related-document) No.4.

The following table shows the setting of terminal software.

#### Terminal software configuration

| Baud rate | Data bit length | Parity check | Stop bits | Flow control |
| --------: | --------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------ |
| 115200bps | 8bits           | none         | 1bit      | none         |

Terminal software outputs the following log at power ON the target.

```text
SCIF Download mode (w/o verification)
(C) Renesas Electronics Corp.

-- Load Program to SystemRAM ---------------
please send !
```

Transfer S-record file after the log output.

S-record file:

- AArch64_output/Flash_Writer_SCIF_`<board_name>`.mot

After the transfer has succeeded, the following log will be shown.

```text
Flash writer for RZ/G2L Series V0.86 Feb.26,2021
>
```

Please enter the any key from the console to continue.

For details on how to write to the Serial Flash and eMMC, please refer to [Section 3.4](#34-command-specification).

### 5.2. Prepare for boot from the Serial Flash and eMMC

To boot from the eMMC, need to change the DIP switch setting.

Regarding the DIP switch configuration on the board, refer to [Related Document](#related-document) No.4.
